# web-traffic-forcast

This code uses the Linear Regression algorithm to train a model on the provided dataset of web traffic data. It then uses the trained model to make predictions on the test set, and calculates the mean squared error between the predicted and actual values. Finally, this code uses the model to make a prediction for future web traffic and suggest number of instances based on the forecasted web traffic.
